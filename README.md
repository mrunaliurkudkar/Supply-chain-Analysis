# Supply-chain-Analysis
"To analyze key supply chain metrics across products, suppliers, shipping, and transportation to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness."

## Project Objectives

- Monitor product-wise supply chain performance across Cosmetics, Haircare, and Skincare.

- Track revenue generation, stock availability, order fulfillment, and defect rates.

- Identify inefficiencies in supplier contributions and regional operations.

- Optimize SKU-level planning and supplier selection.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/amit4910/Supply_chain_Dashboard/blob/main/CDACL-003-Supply%20Chain%20Analysis%20.docx">Supply chain data</a>

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Revenue (per category and total)
- Quantity Sold
- Total SKUs per Category
- Available Stock
- Order Fulfillment Rate (%)
- Average Defect Rate (%)
- Supplier Contribution per SKU

- Dashboard Interaction   <a href="https://github.com/amit4910/Supply_chain_Dashboard/blob/main/snapshot_supply_chain_dashboard.png">View Dashboard</a>

## Process Overview
- Data Collection: Gathered data on production, sales, inventory, suppliers, and quality metrics.

- Dashboard Creation: Designed in Power BI using cards, maps, matrix tables, and bar charts.

- Performance Segmentation: Categorized into Cosmetics, Haircare, and Skincare.

- KPI Calculation: Calculated fulfillment, stock, defect metrics using DAX formulas.

- Supplier Mapping: Linked SKUs to supplier-wise production for comparison.

## Dashboard

## Key Insights
- Skincare has the highest revenue (â‚¹2.41L) and best order fulfillment rate (85%).

- Haircare leads in stock availability (7,990 units) but has the highest defect rate (2.50%).

- Cosmetics shows the lowest order fulfillment rate (73.08%) and lowest revenue.

- Supplier performance varies significantly across categories (e.g., Supplier 2 leads in Cosmetics).

- SKU distribution indicates uneven dependency on specific suppliers.

## Recommendation
- Improve Cosmetics fulfillment by evaluating logistics and inventory planning.

- Reduce Haircare defects through quality checks and supplier re-evaluation.

- Diversify supplier base to avoid over-reliance on specific ones (e.g., Supplier 2).

- Optimize high-performing SKUs in Skincare to maintain revenue growth.

- Standardize supplier performance metrics for consistency.

## Personal Suggestion
- Add filters for time (monthly/quarterly) to track seasonal trends.

- Use conditional formatting in tables for quick anomaly spotting.

- Include forecasting visuals to support future inventory decisions.

- Share the dashboard with procurement and production teams for cross-functional alignment.

- Integrate alerts/thresholds for low stock or high defect rates.
